# tabbed-scratpad-addon-extension
Continue from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scratchpad/ with new features:
- Auto-save (session)
- Tabbed
- Minimize

From Google Gemini with love.
The reason why this addon is forked because the original addon has so many issues, and I want to improve my workflow with minimize to at least hide the window to Taskbar, but then I add more and more features to it and now... Tabbed, Session and.. Maybe theme support ? I don't know.

If you're a developer, having a great development tools for your needs is so important, I'm using this addon to test complex script, run multiple scripts one after another for quick and dirty testing..
